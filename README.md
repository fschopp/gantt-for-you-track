  - [fschopp/project-planning-for-you-track](https://github.com/fschopp/project-planning-ui-for-you-track) for the communication with YouTrack.
  - [fschopp/project-planning-js](https://github.com/fschopp/project-planning-js) for the list-scheduling algorithm used for scheduling the unresolved issues.
  - [adamhaile/S.js](https://github.com/adamhaile/S) and [adamhaile/Surplus](https://github.com/adamhaile/surplus) for reactive programming of the user interface.
  - [dhtmlxGantt](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/) for the Gantt widget.
